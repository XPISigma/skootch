A fork of **dagwaging**'s drawing client for the anarchy draw-swapping website [**garyc.me/sketch**](https://garyc.me/sketch),
with additional features like screentoning, filling, and zooming.

> [!warning]
> Because garyc.me/sketch is an anarchy website, drawings on it may be NSFW or even worse than that.<br>
> Check the website with caution, in case you don't already frequent it.

## Development

If you ever wish to work on the client on your own machine:

1. Make sure you have [Bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower) and the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed in your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository, then run `bower install` on it to install project dependencies.

All the other commands listed below will assume your terminal is currently on the clone repository.

### Serving

```sh
$ polymer serve
```

This should serve the whole client locally onto localhost (the port will be shown on the console).
You could also use other methods that start a file server, e.g.
`npx http-server` ([ref](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server#installation)).

### Building

```sh
$ polymer build
```

This should build a minified ES6-compatible version onto `build/es6-bundled/`, as per the project's polymer.json.
To serve the build with the same Polymer CLI:

```sh
$ polymer serve build/es6-bundled
```
